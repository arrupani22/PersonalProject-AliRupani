Personal Python Project Proposal Template
Project Title:
Financial Data Analytics Dashboard: Insights for Investment Decisions
Name:
Ali Rupani
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive financial data analytics dashboard that provides valuable insights to aid investment decision-making. The dashboard will analyze historical stock data, calculate key financial metrics, and visualize trends to help investors make informed choices.
Background and Rationale:
The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing demand for data-driven investment strategies. By leveraging Python programming and financial data analytics techniques, this project aims to address the need for a user-friendly tool that empowers investors to analyze market trends, evaluate stock performance, and identify potential investment opportunities.
Features and Functionality:
Main Features:Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface to access and visualize financial data.
Stock Performance Analysis: Calculate and display historical stock prices, returns, and volatility.
Financial Metric Calculation: Compute key financial metrics such as Sharpe ratio, beta, and moving averages.
Portfolio Optimization: Implement portfolio optimization algorithms to maximize returns and minimize risk.
 v. Sentiment Analysis: Analyze news sentiment and social media chatter to gauge market sentiment.
 vi. User Interface (UI) and Visualization:Utilize libraries like Plotly and Dash for interactive data visualization.
 vii. Implement a responsive web-based dashboard for easy access across devices.
Technologies and Libraries:
Python: Programming language for project development.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computing and array processing.
Matplotlib and Plotly: Data visualization.
Dash: Web framework for building interactive dashboards.
Data Sources:
Stock market data from Yahoo Finance API.
Financial news articles from News API.
Social media data from Twitter API.
Data will be stored and processed in CSV and DataFrame formats.
Project Design:
The project will consist of modular components:Data acquisition: Fetching and preprocessing data from various sources.
Analysis and computation: Calculating financial metrics and performing sentiment analysis.
Visualization: Creating interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash.
